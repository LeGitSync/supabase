This guide walks you through restoring your database from a Supabase platform project to a [self-hosted Docker instance](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker). Storage objects transfer or redeploying edge functions is not covered here.

## Before you begin

You need:

- A running self-hosted Supabase instance ([Docker setup guide](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker))
- [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) installed (or use `npx supabase`)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com) installed (required by the CLI)
- `psql` installed ([official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))
- Your Supabase database passwords (for platform and self-hosted)

## Step 1: Get your platform connection string

On your managed Supabase project dashboard, click [Connect](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) and copy the connection string (use the session pooler or direct connection).

## Step 2: Back up your platform database

Export roles, schema, and data as three separate SQL files:

```bash
supabase db dump --db-url [CONNECTION_STRING] -f roles.sql --role-only
supabase db dump --db-url [CONNECTION_STRING] -f schema.sql
supabase db dump --db-url [CONNECTION_STRING] -f data.sql --use-copy --data-only
```

This produces SQL files that are compatible across PostgreSQL versions.

<Admonition type="note">

Using `supabase db dump` executes `pg_dump` under the hood but applies Supabase-specific filtering - it excludes internal schemas, strips reserved roles, and adds idempotent `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses. Using raw `pg_dump` directly will include Supabase internals and cause permission errors during restore. CLI requires Docker because it runs `pg_dump` inside a container from the Supabase Postgres image rather than requiring a local PostgreSQL installation.

</Admonition>

## Step 3: Prepare your self-hosted instance

Before restoring, check the following on your self-hosted instance:

- **Extensions**: Enable any non-default extensions your Supabase project uses. You can check which extensions are active by querying `select * from pg_extension;` on your managed database (or check Database Extensions in Dashboard).

## Step 4: Restore to your self-hosted database

Connect to your self-hosted Postgres and restore the dump files. The [default](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) connection string for self-hosted Supabase is:

```
postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres
```

Where `[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]` is the value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your self-hosted `.env` file.

Run `psql` to restore:

```bash
psql \
  --single-transaction \
  --variable ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file roles.sql \
  --file schema.sql \
  --command 'SET session_replication_role = replica' \
  --file data.sql \
  --dbname "postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres"
```

Setting `session_replication_role` to `replica` disables triggers during the data import, preventing issues like double-encryption of columns.

## Step 5: Verify the restore

Connect to your self-hosted database and run a few checks:

```bash
psql "postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres"
```

```sql
-- Check your tables are present
\dt public.*

-- Verify row counts on key tables
SELECT count(*) FROM auth.users;

-- Check extensions
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

## What's included and what's not

The database dump includes your schema, data, roles, RLS policies, database functions, triggers, and `auth.users`. However, several things require separate configuration on your self-hosted instance:

| Requires manual setup | How to configure |
| --- | --- |
| JWT secrets and API keys | Generate new ones and update `.env` |
| Auth provider settings (OAuth, Apple, etc.) | Configure `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables in `.env` |
| Edge functions | Manually copy to your self-hosted instance |
| Storage objects | Transfer separately (not covered in this guide) |
| SMTP / email settings | Configure `SMTP_*` variables in `.env` |
| Custom domains and DNS | Point your DNS to the self-hosted server |

## Auth considerations

Your `auth.users` table and related data are included in the database dump, so user accounts are preserved. However:

- **JWT secrets differ** between your platform and self-hosted instances. Existing tokens issued by the platform project will not be valid. Users will need to re-authenticate.
- **Social auth providers** (Apple, Google, GitHub, etc.) need to be configured in your self-hosted `.env` file. Set the relevant `GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_*` variables. See the Auth repository [README](https://github.com/supabase/auth) for all available options.
- **Redirect URLs** in your OAuth provider consoles (Apple Developer, Google Cloud Console, etc.) must be updated to point to your self-hosted hostname instead of `*.supabase.co`.

## Postgres version compatibility

Managed Supabase may run a newer Postgres version (Postgres 17) than the self-hosted Docker image (currently Postgres 15). The `supabase db dump` command produces plain SQL files that work across major Postgres versions.

Keep in mind:

- If your platform database uses features specific to a newer Postgres, the restore may fail. This should be rare in standard Supabase usage.
- Run the restore on a test self-hosted instance first if you're unsure about compatibility.
- Check that all extensions you use are available on the self-hosted Postgres version.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not available

If the restore fails because an extension isn't available, check whether it's supported on your self-hosted PostgreSQL version. You can list available extensions with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

### Connection refused

Make sure your self-hosted Postgres port is accessible. In the default [self-hosted Supabase](/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#accessing-postgres) setup, the user is `postgres.your-tenant-id` with Supavisor on port `5432`.

### Custom roles missing passwords

If you created custom database roles with the `LOGIN` attribute on your platform project, their passwords are not included in the dump. Set them manually after restore:

```sql
ALTER ROLE your_custom_role WITH PASSWORD 'new-password';
```
